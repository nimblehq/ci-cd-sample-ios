# ci-cd-sample-ios
This project is all about setting up `CI/CD` from scratch for an iOS Project

### Objectives:
- Work on the tasks of setting up the CI/CD pipeline from a newly bootstrapped application from the template. Make sure to delete the already implemented CI/CD pipeline.

- Use Bitrise to set up the CI/CD pipeline.
	- Automate build and test based on github events
	- Show test coverage report
	- Add linting

- Ensure that the application codebase is well tested throughout changes (CI) and has a legit automated release cycle (CD) via Firebase.

## Getting Started


### Requirements

- Xcode `13.3+`
- iOS 12.0+
